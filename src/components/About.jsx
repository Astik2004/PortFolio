            I am a recent <b>B.Tech</b> graduate in <b>Computer Science & Engineering</b> from<b> United College of Engineering Research</b>, where I achieved an <b>8.19 CGPA</b>.
            My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming,
            software development, and a particular focus on full-stack web development
            using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
            Throughout my studies, I gained hands-on experience by working on projects
            that transformed theoretical concepts into practical applications. 
            One of my key projects was leading the development of a Plant Disease Detection System,
            utilizing the MERN stack to create an application that diagnoses plant diseases from images. 
            This project enhanced my skills in building scalable, user-friendly web applications and
            deepened my understanding of full-stack development.In addition, I developed a Student
            Management System, which streamlined student record management using Node.js, 
            React, and MongoDB. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in both front-end and
            back-end development, as well as my ability to create efficient, user-centric solutions.
            I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including <b>Java, C++,JavaScript C, and SQL,</b> 
            which complement my expertise in web technologies. I am passionate about continuous 
            learning and stay updated with the latest advancements in technology. In my free time, 
            I enjoy exploring new programming concepts, reading about tech trends, and playing cricket.
            As I embark on my professional journey, I am eager to apply my skills and fresh perspective
            to innovative projects. I am excited to join a dynamic team where I can contribute meaningfully 
            and continue growing as a developer.
